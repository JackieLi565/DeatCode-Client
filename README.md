# DeatCode-Client
Deatcode is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack. 
It provides users with the ability to solve one Leetcode problem every day, which is then tracked and rewarded with points upon completion. 
The application also includes a feature where users can earn more points by consistently solving problems every day. 
In addition, Deatcode includes an explore page that allows users to create and post their own problems.
